# x402-bch Client Demo

This directory contains a reference client for the Bitcoin Cash adaptation of the x402 protocol. The client script (`bch-client.js`) exercises the end-to-end flow described in the core [x402 specification](../../specs/x402-specification.md) and in the BCH-focused [x402-bch specification](../../specs/x402-bch-specification.md). It showcases how an HTTP consumer can satisfy `402 Payment Required` responses by funding and reusing BCH UTXOs through a Facilitator.

## Where the Client Fits
- **Clients** originate HTTP requests, learn pricing from `402` responses, and present signed BCH payment payloads.
- **Servers** protect API resources, advertise BCH pricing metadata, and forward payment headers for verification.
- **Facilitators** verify signatures, track debit balances for funded UTXOs, and return validation decisions.

This client demonstrates the Client role: it detects `402` responses, funds a BCH UTXO via the helper in `axios-402-handler.js`, signs authorization payloads, and retries the original request until the Facilitator confirms payment.

## Features
- Handles the full BCH `utxo` scheme payload (`signature`, `txid`, `vout`, debit amount) described in the spec.
- Automatically retries requests that receive `402` responses after attaching `X-PAYMENT` headers.
- Reuses ledger balances tracked by the Facilitator until a UTXO is exhausted.
- Uses `minimal-slp-wallet` utilities for BCH key management and transaction introspection.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 20 LTS or newer (required for ES module compatibility).
- npm 9+ (ships with Node 20).
- Access to an x402-bch Resource Server and Facilitator (see [Facilitator](../facilitator/) and [Server](../server/) directories for demos).

## Installation
```bash
cd examples/client
npm install
```

## Configuration
Copy the `.env-local` file as `.env`. Customize the environment variables as needed:

To generate your own key pair, you can go to [wallet.psfoundation.info](https://wallet.psfoundation.info). Navigate to the `Wallet` page.

## Running the Demo
```bash
npm start
```

The script performs three steps:
1. Requests the resource without payment to trigger an HTTP `402` and log the advertised `PaymentRequirements`.
2. Funds a BCH UTXO, signs the authorization payload, retries the request, and logs the successful response once the Facilitator validates the payment.
3. Issues a follow-up request that reuses the same UTXO balance until it is depleted.

Facilitator responses (such as remaining satoshis) are visible in the console output. You can adjust `PAYMENT_AMOUNT_SATS` to experiment with batching multiple paid calls.

## Related Components
- [x402-bch-axios library](https://github.com/x402-bch/x402-bch-axios): Wraps Axios with interceptors that detect `402` responses, build BCH payment payloads, and manage retries.
- [Facilitator](../facilitator/): Reference Facilitator service that verifies BCH payment payloads and maintains UTXO ledgers.
- [Server](../server/): Example resource server that publishes BCH pricing metadata and delegates verification to the Facilitator.

## Troubleshooting
- **402 loops**: Ensure the private key was funded and that the Facilitator recognizes the `payTo` address advertised by the server.
- **Signature errors**: Verify the `PRIVATE_KEY` matches the `from` address and that your environment uses UTF-8 encoding.
- **Network mismatches**: Confirm the server and client are both set to use the `bch` network and the `utxo` scheme.
