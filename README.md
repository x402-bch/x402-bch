# x402 payments protocol for Bitcoin Cash

This repository is modeled on the original [x402 repository](https://github.com/coinbase/x402/tree/main) created by Coinbase. While their specifications and examples for x402 implementation is focused on using the USDC stablecoin on the Base blockchain, this repository is focused on an implementation for the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain. The techniques used by the x402-bch protocol can be adapted for any L1 UTXO-based blockchain.
